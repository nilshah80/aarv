## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- Core framework APIs for routing, grouped routes, middleware, hooks, binding, validation, and structured error handling
- Pooled request context, pluggable JSON codecs, graceful shutdown, TLS, HTTP/2, and mutual TLS support
- Test helpers and expanded plugin coverage across the built-in plugin packages

### Changed
- Raised non-example package coverage to 98.7%
- Completed GoDoc coverage for the public API surface
- Hardened nil-handling and panic-recovery paths in the core app and middleware integration
- Improved TLS configuration handling by cloning caller configs, enforcing secure minimums, and honoring HTTP/2 disablement safely
- Redacted sensitive query parameters in the verbose logging plugin in addition to existing header and body redaction

### Security
- Completed an OWASP-focused review of the current framework surface
- Verified that standard and verbose logging avoid exposing secrets by default-sensitive redaction paths
- Ran `govulncheck ./...`; findings are limited to Go standard library issues in `go1.26.0`, fixed upstream in `go1.26.1`

### Performance
- 154K RPS with logger middleware (comparable to Gin/Mach)
- 151K RPS with encryption middleware
- ~82 allocs/op with full request ID tracking
- P50 latency: ~555µs, P99 latency: ~1.9ms
